        <h1>What is my engineering style?</h1>
        <p class="date">Sonny George<br>September 8, 2025</p>
        
        <p>I believe the bottleneck for delivering great programs is NEVER the speed of code generation (i.e., how fast you can write code).</p>
        
        <p>Sure, spewing out code quickly can be useful for competitive programming and interviews. However, I am generally of the thinking that engineers ought to work carefully and thoughtfully, "measuring twice and cutting once." </p>

        <p>I consider my programming style to be incremental, testable, and “first-things-first”.</p>
            
        <p>In college, I was never the fastest at taking math tests, but I always sat there until, in my mind, there was no possible way any of the answers could be something other than what I had written down.</p>

        <p>I believe every software engineer ought to watch <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0OYeOMIdYHLQtC1_gYKgIxeIpAdlcaCS&feature=shared">these videos</a> and ponder <a href="https://gist.github.com/tooolbox/7e5f8afc32589007b5f41e1921b7ffb3">these software parables</a>.</p>
